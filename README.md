## Description

* Building a music player app requires a great deal of attention to detail. It needs to have a fast and smooth user interface with clean code structure. To achieve this, developers must use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the source code clone that will be used for the UI design. By doing so, they can ensure that the app allows users to hear music quickly and easily without any issues. Additionally, it will also create an aesthetically pleasing experience for users with its attractive design.
